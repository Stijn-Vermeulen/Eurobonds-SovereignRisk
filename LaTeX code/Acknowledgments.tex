Writing this thesis has been an interesting challenge and several people deserve special thanks for making it possible.\\

First of all, I would like to thank Professor Kobielarz for providing the opportunity to write this dissertation and for his supervision during the past year. His feedback and assistance was beyond doubt helpful and it has provided an invaluable learning experience.\\

Second, I would like to thank my significant other and my parents for the tremendous support they have provided me. Their continuous encouragements have kept me going forward and this thesis would not be what it is without them.\\

Finally, I would like to thank any friends, family, colleagues and anyone else who listened (voluntarily or not) to me rambling about "non-defaultable debt" or "sovereign default models" the past couple of months. It is much appreciated.\\
